## N1-Methylnicotinamide (NMN)-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of NMN as MATE1 and OCT2 biomarker

### Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of NMN, that has been carefully developed using a large number of clinical studies and evaluated within our drug-biomarker interaction modeling network. The model applies endogenous synthesis in liver cells, metabolism via AOX1, active tubular secretion via OCT2 and MATE1, active tubular reabsorption as well as diurnal variation.

The MoBi project file contains simulations of clinical studies utilized during model establishment, including the respective observed data [[1](#reference)][[2](#reference)][[3](#reference)]. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[4](#reference)].
